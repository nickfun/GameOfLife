About
=====

Conways game of life implemented in Java. It's a simple project to teach myself about java fundamentals. It's got JFames, timers, mouse event callbacks, and other interesting things. I hope to add more features and maybe turn it into a screen saver. I remember screen savers :D

Running
-------

I use sbt v1.4.5

use `sbt package` and it will create a jar file in the target fold.

Then you can run it with `java -jar target/game-of-life-0.1.jar`
